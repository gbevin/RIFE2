<p>RIFE2 is a full-stack, no-declaration, framework to quickly and effortlessly
  create web applications with modern Java.</p>

<p>RIFE2 is built on the foundations of the original RIFE framework that was
  popular from 2002-2010. Since then, the world and Java have changed and many of
  the original RIFE APIs could finally be replaced with pure Java, no-XML,
  no-YAML, leaving only type-safe expressive code.</p>

<p>RIFE2 preserves most of the original features and adds new ones, for a fraction
  of the footprint and with even greater developer productivity than before.
  RIFE2 is created by Geert Bevin, one of the first Java Champions and speaker at
  many Java conferences.</p>
