/**
 * Represents one connection to a database. A connection has to be obtained by
 * using the {@code getConnection} method on a {@code Datasource}
 * instance. The resulting {@code DbConnection} instance can be used to
 * obtain statement objects from and to manage transactions.
 * <p>Statements are used to execute SQL queries either in a static or in a
 * prepared fashion. This corresponds to the {@code DbStatement} and
 * {@code DbPreparedStatement} classes. Look there for details about how
 * to use them. A {@code DbConnection} keeps track of which statements
 * have been openened and will automatically close them when database access
 * errors occur or when the connection itself is closed.
 * <p>Several statements can be executed as a whole through the use of
 * transactions. Only if they all succeeded, the transaction should be
 * committed and all the modifications will be preserved. Otherwise, the
 * transaction should be rolled back, and the modifications will not be
 * integrated into the general data storage. When a transaction has been
 * started through the {@code beginTransaction()} method, it will be
 * bound to the currently executing thread. Other threads will not be able to
 * manipulate the transaction status and if they obtain and execute
 * statements, they will be put in a wait state and woken up again after the
 * transaction has finished.
