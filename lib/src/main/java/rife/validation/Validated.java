/**
 * This interface defines methods for bean-centric data validation.
 * <p>Validation is bound to subjects that have distinct names. Each subject
 * corresponds to a different variable, for example a property of a bean. When
 * a subject is found to be invalid, a corresponding instance of
 * {@code ValidationError} has to be registered.
 * <p>{@code ValidationError}s indicate in detail why a
 * {@code Validated} object doesn't contain valid data. They should be
 * stored internally and can be manipulated by other classes that are able to
 * work with {@code Validated} objects. This makes it possible to collect
 * errors incrementally in one central place and to allow each component in a
 * system to perform its own part of the validation.
 * <p>A {@code Validated} object has a {@link #validate() validate()}
 * method which should be used to perform mandatory validation on subjects and
 * data that the object itself knows about. This validation has to perform all
 * checks that guarantee a coherent internal state of the data. Note that this
 * method should not reset the validation, but instead add new validation
 * errors to an already existing collection.
 * <p>Since it's possible that subjects generate multiple
 * {@code ValidationError}s, it's possible to limit their number and only
 * store the first error that occurs for a particular subject.
