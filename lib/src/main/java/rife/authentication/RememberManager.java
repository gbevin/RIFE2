 * This interface defines the methods that classes with

 * <p>A {@code RememberManager} is reponsible for coupling a user ID to
 * an expiring remember ID. The remember ID is typically stored in a cookie in
 * the browser and expires after a certain duration. An authentication element
 * that uses a {@code RememberManager}, should erase the remember ID
 * after using it once, create a new one immediately and send it to the
 * client. This ensures that each remember ID can only be used once.
