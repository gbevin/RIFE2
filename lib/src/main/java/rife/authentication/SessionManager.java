 * related to the lifetime of a session in which a user is successfully
 * authenticated.
 * <p>This kind of session doesn't provide any state persistence across
 * requests and doesn't store any additional business data on the server-side.
 * It merely provides a unique authentication id which can be used to identify
 * a successfully authenticated user.
 * <p>For safety's sake, sessions time out after a certain period of
 * inactivity and their validity is bound only to a unique user id.
 * No assumptions are being made about the actual meaning or structure of
 * a 'user'. A unique numeric identifier is all that's required.
